subtitle: Why you'd want to collaborate with me?

Hi there! I'm a passionate and dedicated researcher in the field of artificial intelligence, with a strong background in software development and machine learning. I am currently working at Yahoo! Inc., where I am designing and continually enhancing an AI/ML-based ETL pipeline that powers Yahoo Location search. I am also developing a geo-spatial matching algorithm with Apache Spark and Sedona, tackling large-scale geo datasets and complex spatial queries.

I completed my MS in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Pennsylvania State University, where I was co-advised by Dr. C. Lee Giles and Dr. Jian Wu. My research focused on deep learning pipelines for extracting, clustering, and classifying scientific figures using Vision Transformers (ViT). At the Intelligent Information Systems Lab, I primarily contributed to boosting the capabilities of search engines like COVIDSeer and CiteSeer, demonstrating my expertise in search engines.

I'm particularly passionate about contributing to the development of multimodal datasets, architectures, and retrieval systems that integrate both image and text data. Driven by a commitment to advancing AI through innovative research and impactful applications, I’m excited about the possibilities ahead and can’t wait to see where this journey takes me next!
